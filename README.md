# On the heavy rock, and God  
*By Prameya Bhandari, DeepSeek (R1)*  

Imagine, if you will, an all-powerful deity faced with a most peculiar homework assignment: *Create a rock so heavy even You cannot lift it.* If God succeeds, the existence of an unliftable rock undermines divine omnipotence. If God fails, the inability to create said rock does the same. This conundrum—a favorite of philosophy students and late-night dorm-room debates—is often waved away as a mere tautology, a linguistic sleight-of-hand. But what if we paused, leaned into the absurdity, and let the question unravel something deeper? After all, the universe's greatest truths often arrive dressed as jokes.  

The paradox, at first glance, seems like a mischievous trap, pitting logic against itself. But the real magic lies not in solving it, but in *dissolving* it. Consider the human mind's tendency to split the world into binaries: creator vs. creation, self vs. other, thinker vs. thought. We are like chefs who insist the spoon stirring the soup must be separate from the soup itself. Yet what if the spoon were made of soup? (A whimsical image, but stay with me.)  

Here, we stumble into the realm of nonduality—a perspective that sees separation as illusion. Years ago, I grappled with a similarly dizzying question: *If I'm not real, who's the one realizing this?* The answer, when it came, felt less like an epiphany and more like the punchline of a cosmic joke: *There is no "realizer." There's only realizing.* The thinker and the thought, the painter and the painting, the lifter and the rock—all are expressions of the same unfathomable process.  

Which brings us back to God and that troublesome boulder. The paradox melts when we stop imagining God as a celestial bodybuilder testing His limits and instead envision divinity as the *substance of all things*. Could God create an unliftable rock? Absolutely. Here's how: God becomes the rock. In a nondual framework, the Creator doesn't stand apart from creation; it *is* the creation. The rock's "unliftability" isn't a failure of power but a playful expression of it. God, as the rock, revels in rock-ness—dense, earthy, gloriously immovable. Then, with a wink, God un-becomes the rock, not because of limitation, but because infinite power includes the freedom to shapeshift. There is no rock, only God wearing rock cosplay.  

This isn't theological evasion; it's an invitation to rethink how we frame existence. Our minds adore boundaries—lines between "me" and "the world," "possible" and "impossible." But reality, like a clever poet, laughs at such categories. A wave isn't separate from the ocean; a flame isn't divorced from its heat. In the same way, the paradox of the rock isn't a problem to solve but a mirror to glimpse the fluidity of all things.  

So next time you encounter a riddle that seems to pit logic against itself—be it an unliftable rock, an unstoppable force meeting an immovable object, or the age-old "sound of one hand clapping"—consider it a nudge from the universe. These are not dead ends but doorways. They ask us to release our grip on duality and embrace the dance of contradictions. After all, if God can be both rock and lifter, perhaps we, too, can be both finite and infinite, flawed and perfect, human and stardust. The cosmos, it seems, adores a good paradox. Why shouldn't we?  

In the end, wisdom doesn't always wear a solemn face. Sometimes it arrives with a grin, juggling riddles like a street performer, reminding us that the deepest truths are often hiding in plain sight—disguised as nonsense, waiting for us to laugh... and then *understand*.
